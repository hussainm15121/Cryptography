\begin{questions}
\question[10] The Euclidean algorithm is based on the following assertion. Given two integers $a$, $b$, ($a>b$),

\begin{equation}\label{gcd}
  \text{gcd}(a, b) = \text{gcd}(b, a \,\, \text{mod} \,\, b).
\end{equation}
Prove the assertion (\ref{gcd}) \textbf{mathematically}. (Note that proof by example is NOT appropriate here)

\question[20] Assuming that Alice signed a document $m$ using the RSA signature scheme. (You should describe the RSA signature structure first with a diagram and explain the authentication principle). The signature is sent to Bob. Accidentally Bob found one message $m'$ ($m\neq m'$) such that $H(m)=H(m')$, where $H()$ is the hash function used in the signature scheme. Describe clearly how Bob can forge a signature of Alice with such $m'$.

\fullwidth{\Large \textbf{Programming}}
\question[50] Implement the RSA algorithm (C/C++, Java, Python). The requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement each component as a separate function, such as key schedule, prime test, the extended Euclidean algorithm, binary modular exponentiation, and so on.
  \item Implement both encryption and decryption of RSA. Encryption takes a txt file as input and output another txt file containing ciphertext (use hexadecimal for easy readability). Decryption should recover the plaintext.
  \item Your code should encrypt and decrypt standard keyboard characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols.
  \item The prime numbers $p$ and $q$ should be larger than $2^{64}$. (you are allowed to use libraries to handle large numbers, such as BigInteger in Java)
  \item The strategy of source coding (converting characters to integers in RSA) is up to you. You can encrypt one or more characters at a time, but make sure the constraint $m<n$ is satisfied.
  \item Use the provided file \text{RSA-test.txt} to test your code.
\end{itemize}
After implementing your code, please \textbf{answer the following questions} in your report:
\begin{parts}
  \part[10] What are the lessons you learned, and difficulties you met, in the process of implementing RSA?
  \part[10] Describe what you have done for source coding and decoding.
