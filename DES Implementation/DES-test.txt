%%%=========================== Begining of the questions ================================
\uplevel{\Large \textbf{Attack a cipher}}
\begin{questions}
\question Please download the file \textit{cipher.txt} and try to decrypt it, assuming the plaintext is plain English that makes sense. You need to do the following.
\begin{parts}
  \part[10] Write a program (C/C++, Java, Python) to perform the letter frequency analysis attack.
  \part[10] Write a program (C/C++, Java, Python) to perform the brute-force attack (exhaustive key search).
  \part[10] Write a report to state
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What you have done in your code step-by-step
      \item The substitution table obtained by letter frequency analysis
      \item The key found by brute-force attack
    \end{itemize}
\end{parts}

\vspace{0.5in}
\fullwidth{\Large \textbf{Implement DES}}
\question[30] Please implement the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm (C/C++, Java, Python). The requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement each component as a separate function, such as key schedule, permutation, SBox, f function, encryption, decryption.
  \item Ask the user to input the key of any length, which means you need to do padding or chopping if necessary. Think about your padding strategy.
  \item Implement both encryption and decryption of DES. Encryption takes a txt file as input and output another txt file containing ciphertext (use hexadecimal for easy readability). Decryption should recover the plaintext.
  \item you code should encrypt and decrypt standard keyboard characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols.
  \item Use the provided file \text{DES-test.txt} to test your code.
\end{itemize}
After implementing your code, please \textbf{answer the following questions} in your report:
\begin{parts}
  \part[10] What are the lessons you learned, and difficulties you met, in the process of implementing DES?
  \part[10] (\textbf{ISEC2000}) What will happen if the key is initialised as all 0-bits? (\textbf{ISEC5002}) Which operations are confusion, which operations are diffusion, in DES? Explain your reasoning. (answer one of them based on your enrollment)
\end{parts}

\vspace{0.5in}
\fullwidth{\Large \textbf{Lab demo}}
\question[20] After the assignment due, you will perform a brief demonstration of your code, during the practical sessions. Each of you will be given around 5 minutes, so make sure your code is working and it is consistent with your submission.
\end{questions}
